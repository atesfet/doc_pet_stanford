Dynamic Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Data Analysis Tutorial
=================================================================

This tutorial aims to demonstrate how to obtain perfusion or cerebral blood flow (CBF) using dynamic O15-water PET data collected by GE's PET (or PET/MRI) scanners at Stanford University. The same technique can be applied to dynamic PET data acquired using other tracers such as FDG.

Pre-requisite
-------------

1 Download and install `FSL <https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki>`_

2 Download and install `dcm2niix <https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix>`_

3 Download and install `MATLAB <https://www.mathworks.com/?s_tid=gn_logo>`_

4 Understand the basics of `PET imaging <https://www.radiologyinfo.org/en/info.cfm?pg=pet>`_

5 Able to visualize PET neuroimaging data in NIfTI format


Sample Data
-----------

We will use a sample dataset of a healthy volunteer collected by a GE 3T PET/MRI system. The dataset includes a T1 weighted structural image and PET images acquired using GE's PET/MRI system. This dataset can be downloaded `here <https://github.com/mosszhaodphil/doc_pet_stanford/tree/master/data>`_.

You may include the following description in your manuscript:

An image-derived arterial input function (AIF) was estimated from dynamic PET data in the carotid arteries including corrections for spill-in and out artifacts using the high-resolution segmentation of the cervical MRA and GRE data for masking [1]. This AIF and dynamic PET data were then incorporated into the one-compartment pharmacokinetic model to quantify voxel-wise CBF. The model was implemented in the spatially regularized Variational Bayesian Inference framework in FSL [2].
